Portleaf Project

The portleaf project is an inspiring portfolio. A dual intension, inspire myself and my acheivements and a looking glass for others to understand who I am and what I'm worth but most importantly to grasp my passion.

Key features:
- Multiple layouts. Show how modular the code is by adapting to different view models.
    - Simple concise Moon themed layout (Astronomy)
    - Paralax layout, think AK, show beautiful design that's not literal art.
    - Color Changing theme (Just want to explore doing this)
- Overivew Page
    - Nav/Menu to Projects.
        - Sub Nav to Forge Items
- Project Page
    - two list sections
        - The Vault
            A large list of all I've ever done. Highlight that some items here are old school projects. or dead projects
            I want to show all I have done, but no one cares for the details here. Name, Photo, Desc, Tags. 
        - The Forge
            These projects are likely to be indefinitely maintained* (hah). This list should remain small because I want people to look and explore the small set of excellent work. This list will have similar list items to the vault: Name, Photo, Desc, Tags. However, each item can be expanded into a details page.
                - Details Page goes in more depth about the project.
                    - Expanded descriptions
                    - Motivations
                    - Hardships
                    - View Code
                    - View Demo's
- Keep it simple to two pages... no one cares to read an about section the person. This portfolio should seap with my essence (ew?) dont need to describe with words who I am I'm not a writter. No need for a skills section, the portfolio and forge projects should make that obvious. They want work exp? Goto Linkedin. They want to see my programming languages? My Forge projects will have tags, github will have tags.


Project QVision
This is my C++ playground. QVision = QontrolVision = Control Vision. An Toolbox project that provides system automation via computer vision.
- Key Features:
    - C++. To Learn, for versitility, to explore compatibility.
    - Automation in C++. Fast, Injection, Anything.
    - Computer Vision with C++. Fast,
    - Can write a scripting API (Lua or Python) library for easy use


Project - Relative Task Tracker (Bullet Journal)
-This is an excuse to play around with React and a backend. Simple Front-end, Simple Back-end allowing room for all the technical growth in between.
The idea is to have an account based tracking systme for absolute and relative todos. Mostly house chores. Setup relative recurences for things like vacuming and fridge cleaning. Setup absolute recurences for things like water heater maintenence and filter changes. Could extend this crossing over from house to car maintnence. This can have the ability to be shared between user accounts (share chores).

Motivations
- Highlight that this is meant have an overview like a bullet Journal but since its software its not concrete like pen on paper.

        | Jan | Feb | 
Task 1  |  o  |  x  | 

- In the future I could port this to new front end frameworks or port the backend etc.


Project Tether
Long distance motivations to a shared content browsing experience. Two virtical scrolls. One is yours one is shared.
Is is just discord with less features... pretty much... but its a pet project nothing more.
